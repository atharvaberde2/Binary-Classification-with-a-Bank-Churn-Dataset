# Binary-Classification-with-a-Bank-Churn-Dataset
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a bank. The goal was to identify customers who are likely to leave the bank, enabling the bank to take proactive measures to retain them. Utilized ensemble Machine Learning Algorithms and achieved an 87% validation accuracy on Kaggle.
